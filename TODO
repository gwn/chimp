readline support

line 32: stderr to /dev/null hack

also print messages to tty
  "tee /dev/tty | less -r" causes problems, investigate

error handling and user-friendly error messages

caching and flushing cache

allow selecting lists, campaigns, etc. and then working in them by default, like
mysql "use" command

write installation instructions for requirement libs

save command history
save response history (cache), limited by a certain timespan and a total file
size

try to implement readline without rlwrap dependency
  bare read -e does not fulfill the requirements
